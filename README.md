# BTR

The work presented is the result of my Bachelor Thesis Research at the Maastricht Science Programme under the supervision of Mario Senden and Tonio Weidler from the [CCN Maastricht](https://www.ccnmaastricht.com/).

# Musculotendinous Model of the Hand

The hand model is based on the [mujoco menagerie](https://github.com/deepmind/mujoco_menagerie) model of the ShadowRobot Dexterous Hand.

It includes 43 Muscle-Tendon actuators, that approximate the external and internal muscles of the hand.
